\title{Set or return options for stability-based biomarker selection}
\description{
  A function to set options for stability-based biomarker selection in
  the \pkg{BioMark} package, or to return the current options.
}
\usage{
biom.options(\dots)
}
\arguments{
  \item{\dots}{a single list, a single character vector, or any number
    of named arguments (\var{name = value}).}
}
\details{
  If called with no arguments, or with an empty list as the single
  argument, \code{biom.options} returns the current options.

  If called with a character vector as the single argument, a list with
  the arguments named in the vector are returned.

  If called with a non-empty list as the single arguments, the list
  elements should be named, and are treated as named arguments to the
  function.

  Otherwise, \code{biom.options} should be called with one or more named
  arguments \var{name = value}.  For each argument, the option named
  \var{name} will be given the value \var{value}.

  The options are saved in a variable \code{.biom.options} in the global
  environment, and remain in effect until the end of the session.  If
  the environment is saved upon exit, they will be remembered in the
  next session.  The factory defaults can be restored by removing
  \code{.biom.options} from the global environment.

  The recognised options are:
  \describe{
    \item{max.seg}{Maximal number of jackknife iterations. Default: 100.}
    \item{oob.size, oob.fraction}{Size of the out-of-bag fraction, either
      given as an absolute number (oob.size) or as a fraction. Default is
      to leave out ten percent. If oob.size is given explicitly, it takes
      precedence over oob.fraction. Default: oob.fraction = .1.}
    \item{variable.fraction}{Use 1 to always include all variables - use a
      smaller fraction to have a different random subset of all variables
      in each iteration (stability-based identification). Default: .7.}
    \item{ntop}{The number of "top" coefficients taken into account in
      stability-based biomarker identification. If a variable appears
      consistently among the \code{ntop} biggest coefficients, it is said
      to be stable. Default: 10.}
    \item{min.present}{The minimal fraction of times a variable should be in
      the top list to be considered as a potential biomarker
      (stability-based identification). Setting this
      argument to 0 will lead to a list containing all coefficients that
      were present in the top list at least once - a value of 1 only
      returns those variables that are selected in every
      iteration. Default: .1.}
    \item{nset}{The number of permutations to establish null
      distributions for PCR, PLS and VIP statistics in the
      Higher-Criticism approach. Default: 10,000.}
    \item{fmethods}{All biomarker selection methods available within
      BioMark. Currently equal to \code{c("studentt", "shrinkt", "pcr",
	"pls", "vip", "lasso"}. } 
    \item{univ.methods}{The names of the univariate biomarker selection
      methods currently known to BioMark. Currently equal to
      \code{c("studentt", "shrinkt")}}
    \item{HCalpha}{The default of the alpha parameter in the HC
      method. Value: 0.1.}
    \item{lasso}{a list of arguments passed to the underlying
      \code{glmnet} function, such as \code{family}, \code{nlambda},
      \code{alpha}, \code{lambda}, or \code{lambda.min.ratio}. For
      binary classification, the "binomial" family is the default, but
      the most similar setting compared to the other methods in the package
      is \code{family = "gaussian"}. For choices other than the default,
      a warning is printed to the screen.}

\section{Side Effects}{
  If any named argument (or list element) was provided,
  \code{biom.options} updates the elements of the option list
  \code{.biom.options} in the global environment.
}
\value{
  A list with the (possibly changed) options.  If any named argument (or
  list element) was provided, the list is returned invisibly.

\examples{
## Return current options:
biom.options()
biom.options("max.seg")

## Set options:
biom.options(max.seg = 100, oob.fraction = .2)
.biom.options$lasso$alpha <- .75
biom.options()
## the next line removes some options - for these, glmnet defaults will be used
biom.options(lasso = list(alpha = .9, family = "binomial"))

## Restore factory settings:
rm(.biom.options)
biom.options()

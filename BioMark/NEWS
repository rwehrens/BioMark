0.4.2: - updated maintainers' email address
       - fixed NAMESPACE issues
       - changed the way global options are handled

0.4.1: - updated citation information: an appropriate reference for
       	 the software package is now available, rather than a
       	 reference to the first paper in which the package was used.

0.4.0: - added lasso and elastic nets to the list of methods for
       	 "coef" and "stab"; also changes in biom.options and
       	 get.biom. Additional function traceplot.
       - return values for auxiliary functions like studentt.stab and
       	 friends have changed: now they only contain (corrected)
       	 frequencies in which a particular variable is among the ntop
       	 best variables. Also the names have changed: coef.size now is
       	 only returned when type == "coef"
       - coef.BMark function no longer returns indices of selected
       	 variables but coefficient sizes when type == "coef" (this was
       	 already the case), selection frequencies for stability
       	 selection, and estimated p values for HC thresholding.
       - added "selection" function to get the selected variables
       - the input of the get.biom function is changed:
       	 for classification cases Y must be a factor. If a numerical
       	 vector is used for Y with only two different values, it is
       	 converted into a factor with a warning.
       - output of the get.biom function is organized differently: now
       	 the top level of the list consists of the different methods
       	 (studentt, vip, lasso), and the second level consists of the
       	 different parameter settings for each method (lambda for
       	 lasso, ncomp for plsda/pclda/vip).
       - now also support for regression in stability selection. As a
       	 result, naming of fmethods has changed: "plsda" and "pclda"
       	 are now replaced by "pls" and "pcr", respectively. The old
       	 names still work but give a warning.
       - updated references (once again)
       - several corrections to man pages (in biom.options, get.biom);
       	 spotted by Nir Shahaf.       	 

0.3.3: - corrected a bug in biom.options()

0.3.2: - added NAMESPACE
       - updated references

0.3.1: - added HCalpha to the options so that HCthresh can be used in
       	 get.biom with different alpha values

0.3.0: - all pls methods now use widekernelpls rather than kernelpls
       - more efficient HC calculations for the multivariate methods,
       	 in particular a more efficient p-value estimation
       - eliminated function studentt.fun since the original in the st
       	 package no longer has the verbose output
       - introduction of BMark object type and the coef, print and
       	 summary generic functions
       - simplification of get.biom function argument list by definition of
       	 biom.options function and .biom.options object, as in the pls
       	 package
       - default values for stability-based selection are now the ones
       	 used in the 2011 ACA paper, in particular the default for
       	 scaling now is "auto" and no longer "none"
       - renaming of all foo.biom functions to foo.stab
       - implementation of Higher Criticism

0.2.6: first version submitted to CRAN, and used in the 2011 ACA publication

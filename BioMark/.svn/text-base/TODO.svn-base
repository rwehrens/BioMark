- before release of 0.4.0: extend gen.data function to include
  functionality used for the BiomCutoff paper.
  Also: remove names in lasso-based selection.

- extensibility: instead of a predefined set of functions, the user
  should be able to use a function of his/her own. This way we do not
  have to keep on adding new things
